== Requirements ==

* WooCommerce 3.3.4 or newer
* [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
* PHP 7.0 or higher
* An SSL certificate must be installed and configured
* Port 443 must not be blocked for outgoing traffic

== Getting started ==

* Sign up to use ([Vipps pÃ¥ Nett](https://www.vipps.no/signup/vippspanett/))
* After 1-2 days you will get an email with login details to Vipps Developer Portal. This is where you can retrieve the API credentials used to configure the plugin in WooCommerce.
* Proceed to "Installation" below

== Installation ==

To use the plugin you need to do the following:

1. Download and activate the plugin from this GitHub repository or Wordpress.org
2. Enable the Vipps Recurring Payments ("Vipps faste betalinger") payment method in WooCommerce: `Settings` -> `Payments (Betalinger)`.
3. Click "Manage" on the Vipps Recurring Payments payment method
4. Proceed to "Retrieving Vipps API Keys" below

= Retrieving Vipps API Keys =

The documentation for retrieving your Vipps API Keys can be found [here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md#getting-the-api-keys).

= Configuration of the plugin =

1. Fill in the `client_id`, `client_secret` and `Vipps-Subscription-Key` found in the previous step.
2. That's it! You can now move on to "Configuring products"

= Configuring products =

Configuring products for use with the Vipps Recurring Payments plugin is not any
different from default WooCommerce, with one exception: The configuration for
whether or not the product is virtual or physical is important to consider.

If a product is virtual the customer will be charged immediately but if the
product is physical you will have to capture the payment manually through the
order in WooCommerce when you have shipped the product.

In most cases your products should be virtual when using subscriptions but it is
possible to use the plugin with physical products if you need to do so.

= Does this plugin work alongside the Vipps for WooCommerce plugin? =

Yes! You can use this plugin at the same time as [Vipps for WooCommerce](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-woocommerce).

= Do I need to have a license for WooCommerce Subscriptions in order to use this plugin? =

Yes, you do. Get it
[here](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).

= Does this plugin work with the WooCommerce Memberships-plugin? =

[WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
and
[WooCommerce Memberships](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/)
are able to work together for access to recurring memberships that unlock content.

**WooCommerce Subscriptions is required in order to use Vipps Recurring Payments for WooCommerce, but Memberships is not.**

You can read about how WooCommerce Subscriptions and WooCommerce Memberships work together [here](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-memberships-subscriptions-integration/).

= How can I get help if I have any issues? =

For issues with the plugin you can submit an issue on GitHub or ask on the support forum on wordpress.org. For other unrelated issues you should [contact Vipps](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/contact.md).

= Where can I use Vipps? =

Vipps is only available in Norway at the moment and only users who have Vipps will be able to pay with Vipps.

= How can I test that the plugin works correctly? =

If you have access to the Vipps test environment you are able to use the test mode by setting the `WC_VIPPS_RECURRING_TEST_MODE` constant in `wp-config.php`.
See the [getting started](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md) guide for details about how to get started using the test environment.

Vipps does not offer test accounts for regular users of the plugin but you can still penny-test the plugin by sending a small amount of money like 1 or 2 NOK using your production keys.
You can then refund or cancel the purchase afterwards.

= Why do I have to capture payments for physical products manually? =

This is because of the Norwegian law. You are not allowed to charge for a physical product before you ship it, without a valid reason to do so.

You can read about it [here](https://www.forbrukertilsynet.no/english/guidelines/guidelines-the-standard-sales-conditions-consumer-purchases-of-goods-the-internet#chapter-7).

If you have a valid reason to do so you can use the "Capture payment instantly" option from the "Vipps Recurring Payments" settings in your product's settings.

= When a renewal happens, why is the order on hold? =

This is because when an order is charged in Vipps it takes 2 days before the payment has been fully captured from the customer's bank account.

After 2 days it will move to the "Processing" status. You can however change the behaviour of this by using the "Default status to give pending renewals" option in the plugin settings.

Alternatively you you could look into using WooCommerce "Early renewals": [https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/early-renewal/](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/early-renewal/) if ensuring the status of a charge is fully completed before a specific date is of up-most importance.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.7 =
* Fix: Delay marking an order as "Failed" for 15 minutes in case the status changes after a prompt to swap card or top-up bank account.
The documentation states the user has a total of 10 minutes to complete the payment, so 15 minutes is a reasonable threshold. You can change this value yourself using the `wc_vipps_recurring_fail_charge_wait_threshold` filter.
* Fix: No longer attempt to cancel an already cancelled charge.
* Enhancement: Bolstered compatibility with WC < 3.0. Created a bunch of helper functions and doubled down on our backwards compatibility with fetching IDs and fetching plus updating meta.

= 1.4.6 =
* Fix: Fix a bug when an agreement is created twice on the same order. We didn't fetch the right charge ID. This is a temporary fix I will have to revisit later on a proper setup.

= 1.4.5 =
* Fix: Changed how we make requests to minimize the amount of times we hit Vipps' rate limits. If you have gotten a lot of exceptions lately
that look like this: `HTTP Response Error: (recurring/v2/agreements/:id/charges) with request body: Array` it's because of rate limits.
* Enhancement: Errors caused by HTTP requests now have more debug information attached to them.

= 1.4.4 =
* Enhancement: Added an option to move renewal orders from "processing" to "completed" when the charge completes in Vipps.

= 1.4.3 =
* Fix: Truncate agreement description if it's longer than 100 characters and truncate productName if it's longer than 45.

= 1.4.2 =
* Fix: Truncate initialCharge description if it's longer than 45 characters.

= 1.4.1 =
* Fix: Added a polyfill for the PHP `array_key_last` function for hosts with PHP < 7.3.0.

= 1.4.0 =
* Enhancement: Added a "Default status to give orders with a reserved charge" option.
* Enhancement: Improved safety of reserved charges, they should never be put in an unrecoverable state anymore. Un-nested payment logic so we should never run into a similar case again.
* Fix: Refunding a reversed charge now works, just like pending charges in version 1.3.9.
* Change: "Default status to give pending renewal orders" default is now "processing" instead of "on hold"
* Change: Removed "completed" as a possible default status for the "Default status to give pending renewal orders" setting as this status is conventionally used for orders that are completely finished.
